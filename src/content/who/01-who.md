### What can you tell about yourself?

You already know my name, so I can generically say I’m an arts person. I enjoy digging into that scene, getting inspired, doing random stuff on sketchbooks, explore the creative process.

I work as a product designer, currently in tech. I have 16 years of design experience in several industries and almost 10 years with digital. But above all, I’m a family man and love spending as much time as possible with them. I'm also shy at first, but if you're patient enough, you'll get to know me and my lousy puns!
