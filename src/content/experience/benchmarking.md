Benchmarking is a no-brainer in design: to look at competitors and mark down what makes them appealing or successful, the latest trend, or understand where and how we can improve. From a business perspective, design-generated benchmarking is one of the best strategies for mature research and design and a short and easy path to experiment and innovate beyond what’s already established.

By looking into the competitive landscape, I aim to help the team identify the market gaps, the opportunities to improve and evolve, and ensure we’re carving out a distinct space in the industry.

I look into making this exercise well-documented and accessible to anyone. This allows us to get a diversified view of the problem and trigger unseen ideas that can disrupt how we see things.
