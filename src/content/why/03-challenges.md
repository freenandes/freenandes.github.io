### What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced?

My biggest challenge is keeping everyone involved and motivated to criticize and collaborate on designs. Sharing with other designers is easier, but often I need collaboration from other departments.

I've found that it works well to be "polite" and communicate succinctly and clearly. Present yourself, explain what you do (it's obvious to you but not to others), explain the problem space well, and present possible solutions. Give time to digest all info and ask for feedback within a well-delimited timeframe.

Another thing is I try to listen carefully to what anyone has to say. I may think that it's a dumb critique at first or that it is too obvious, but sometimes it hides something important that needs to be solved or an important detail that I overlooked.
