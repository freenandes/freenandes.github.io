### How do you measure success?

There are several ways to measure the success of design solutions, and we can definitely explore new ways of measuring it.

User feedback and testing are critical to understand the effectiveness of a solution. If it aligns with the users' needs and if it mitigates their problems. Usability metrics like completion/error rate are essential here too, to help understand where we can fine-tune.

Interviews and surveys with users and customers are also vital to get their perception of our product and level of satisfaction. While we can assess if the product is well accepted, it also helps me a lot to get into their shoes and understand areas of improvement.

I also seek to get relevant business metrics to evaluate the impact of design solutions. This may include KPIs such as conversion rates, user engagement, or revenue generated. Comparison to benchmarks can help; knowing where we are in the market will help us measure our transformation.

Having a well-documented or transparent iterative approach to the design process is also important so everyone can see the mutation of a solution. This way, everyone can understand the value and the effort put into the operation.
