### What values guide you?

I'm focused on being a more efficient communicator. In any context, really: family, neighborhood, work, grocery store, anywhere. I try to listen carefully to others to understand them more and empathize with their feelings.

I feel that's the most important value for a good life and a better relationship with others.
