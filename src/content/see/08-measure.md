### How do you measure success?

There's a lot to choose from. User feedback and testing are critical to understanding effectiveness. If it aligns with users' needs and if it mitigates their problems. Usability metrics like completion/error rate are key here to know where we can fine-tune.

Interviews and surveys with users and customers are also vital to get their perception and level of satisfaction. While we can assess product acceptance, it also helps me, particularly, to understand areas of improvement.

I also seek to get relevant business metrics to evaluate the impact of design solutions. This may include KPIs such as conversion rates, user engagement, or revenue generated. Comparison to benchmarks can help; knowing where we are in the market will help us measure our transformation.

Having a well-documented or transparent iterative approach to the design process is also important so everyone can see the mutation of a solution. This way, everyone can understand the value and the effort put into the operation.
