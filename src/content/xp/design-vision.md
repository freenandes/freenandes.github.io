Designing a vision is about foreseeing the long-term horizon for a product or company's services. I prefer to approach this practice collaboratively by engaging with multiple teams to understand their thoughts and aspirations and to merge a collective vision.

Often, the outcome of envisioning the future is an authentic depiction of what lies ahead. Despite being more theoretical and with some aspects that may not stand the test of time, it offers a more concrete and shared ambition worth striving for. The discourse concerning our objectives becomes more lucid and motivating.

My proficiency with design tools, coupled with a quick ideation process, enables me to turn these visions into convincing visual narratives swiftly. It's about crafting a visual dialogue that not only resonates with the team but also serves as a beacon, guiding our strategic and design decisions.
