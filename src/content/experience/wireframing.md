I have it easy with wireframing. I have some drawing skills that allow me to pass ideas onto paper or digital canvases quickly. I also brainstorm and speak better in images and graphical markings.

In a team, it is easier to discuss visual solutions and propose changes. Everyone has a say in what they see, and possibilities arise. I often facilitate these brainstorming sessions as both presenter and moderator, paving the way for more constructive dialog and iterating product development efficiently.

But we also have the opportunity to test it quickly. These visual artifacts serve as a communication tool with potential users and customers, providing us with a better understanding of what they like or dislike about our products. This helps the team to improve the products and make them more tailored to the end users.
