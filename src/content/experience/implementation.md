The connection between design and implementation is crucial for delivering products and features successfully. My expertise in creating accurate prototypes, which I code myself, along with my documentation skills, facilitates a smooth transition from idea to code. I provide detailed notes and guidelines to the engineering team, ensuring the implementation journey is well-charted and straightforward.

Beyond just delivering designs, I believe in nurturing a collaborative space with engineering from the start. By sharing the designs early on, feasibility evaluations can be carried out in parallel with the design's development process. This ensures that when the design is ready for handover, it already contains a lot of detailed notes and assets that guarantee a smooth and effective implementation.
