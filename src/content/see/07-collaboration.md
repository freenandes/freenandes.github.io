### How do you collaborate with cross-functional teams during the design process?

Itâ€™s natural for designers to be more cross-functional. I usually reach Customer Success, Customer Service teammates, Community Managers, Marketing, Engineering Services, and others. When I do that, I typically absorb information about the customers and understand product use.

We can start with a kickoff call to introduce ourselves, and then a Miro board and a Slack channel will keep the connection. Colleagues love to see a product taking shape, and that motivates them. Also, they can circle that back to customers, who often see new features with good eyes.

With engineers and PMs, the story is similar. We collaborate in Miro and Slack for brainstorming and syncing. And we also gather around something like a one-pager where we centralize all information and links.
