Researching with users is crucial to connect the team with real-life experiences of people and their needs. It helps in shaping more empathetic solutions for users.

With simple user tests, for example, we can quickly venture into the users' minds, testing concepts and generating new ideas. It's a creative practice that not only validates our thoughts but often leads to building a rich ground for brainstorming, experimenting, and conceptualizing designs.

I am motivated to use my organizational and documentation skills to extract more explicit and actionable guidelines for the project. I look to summarize and share the insights, the evidence, and the learnings that determine the best pathway so we can confidently start experimenting.
