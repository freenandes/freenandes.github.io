### How do you approach the research phase?

I advise starting with a data-driven approach. To see what we have, I reach out to other departments or colleagues to get their points of view on the users/market and get empirical data. This usually leads to ideas on where or how to source more concrete data.

I explain why we use it, so everyone can be on the lookout for changes or generate periodic reports. These will become useful once we change or launch a new product.

I also collect the data points on a whiteboard. I map this information and connect it to the designs to invite everyone to participate and iterate. This approach requires a well-organized board to help colleagues to navigate and understand what's there and correlate data and solutions.

- product design documentation
- whiteboard format?
