## Cross Collab

No one's an island. For product design to be effective, it must be able to connect the team and get the best of it.

I aim to get an inclusive and diversified view of problems, processes, and solutions by creating onboarding materials, showcasing designs, and calling for participation in critiquing, testing, and sharing.
