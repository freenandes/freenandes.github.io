This stage is crucial to understanding the final solution. Many adjustments are made at this point.

Depending on the complexity of the project, I am capable of creating quick, high-fidelity prototypes using design tools such as Figma. These prototypes aid in testing usability and give us more confidence in complicated, long-lasting implementations.

Alternatively, I can directly dive into HTML, CSS, and JS and create something that will provide realistic testing data while allowing us to get halfway into a faster implementation.

My design approach is grounded in understanding technical intricacies. Collaboration with the engineering team is pivotal as we explore feasible routes to bring our design vision to life. By engaging with their technology, I aim to carve out compelling and implementable design solutions, making me a valuable asset in bridging design with practical implementation.
