### How do you design for inclusivity?

To me, being inclusive in UX design is about including as many users as possible in enjoying a product, regardless of their limitations. It’s not just about the physical, like visual impairments or being deaf. It’s about adapting to any condition.

Pregnancy, a broken arm, reading difficulties, maybe too much glare on the screen, any condition. To include users, the best we can do is be mindful of their experiences. We must define the reach we want and then establish a method to execute simple implementation efforts and test their efficacy.

The clear benefit is more clout, more adoption of our products. It may not be perfect initially, but we can implement mechanisms to measure and give us insights into what we’re missing. Reaching out to people is critical.
