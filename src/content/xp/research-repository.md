I look at research outputs as pieces to build a living, centralized insights documentation hub. By documentation, I don't simply mean organized notes but an amalgamation of text, diagrams, and drawings that help communicate problems, solutions, ideas, people's needs, and business objectives.

I look into promoting it in the team as a way for us to enable a shared knowledge, processes, and continuous improvement culture.

I believe that with a good research repository, we can infuse user-centricity into what we do and make data-driven decisions.
