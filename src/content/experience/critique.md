I have created a framework for design critique that helps enhance the product design iteration process. It invites participants from the product development field to present their work, be it just a feature or a complete full-fledged product.

The objective of this framework is to be inclusive and to welcome feedback from any professional background within a team, not just from design professionals. Due to necessity, I had to present designs to people who never understood design, because I needed a more unbiased opinion. Creating a presentation structure tailored to collect creative insights from non-creatives is still challenging for me.

Furthermore, acknowledging the demanding nature of our work calendars, Iâ€™ve made it also possible to participate asynchronously. A more sensitive and caring approach that makes leaving a critique easy more laid back, and enticing rather than mandatory. It enables continuous feedback beyond the confines of scheduled sessions.

Still a work in progress, but the results are fascinating since everyone has a take. Surprisingly, many people are interested in giving their feedback early and easily understand the need to do it in the context of product development. Sharing work and receiving feedback is a very underrated activity within product teams, and its benefits are clear. It makes everyone more empathetic and aligned with the goals. This is why I apply this technique when needed to make the design process more cross-collaborative and open.
