### Where do you want to go from here?

I see myself continuing to do good with my design skills. Learn to share, and collaborate better, more effectively. I want to help build a better world where creativity powers innovation.

A world where we have a better relationship with technology. One where everyone is invited and doesn't feel excluded. One everyone can enjoy, enhance and grow their abilities and feel motivated to co-create.

I want to be involved in improving creative processes. I want to improve operations, empower a design culture within product teams, and to design products people love using.
