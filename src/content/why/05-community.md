### How do you stay active and interact with the community?

Due to family needs and time constraints, I do my best to participate in events, primarily online. I get news, tools, and techniques from LinkedIn, newsletters, and some key websites, but I don't put too much pressure on it.

I don't interact much with the design community. I watch and read from afar. I occasionally contributed to some that sparked my interests and hobbies, like open-source web, comic books, graphic design and illustration, radio and music, etc.
