### What do you consider to be your greatest strengths?

I’m obsessed with UI “perfection,” which leads me to put extra effort into conveying ideas accurately. This can quickly become a curse, but my experience is helping me prevent overdoing it. I actually like how nowadays I go faster and get happy with results earlier than before, so it's a strength!

It extends to my modularization obsession. I love optimizing my files, either designs, references, or code, so they are as centralized as possible to save me from repetitive work and iterate faster in the long run.

I also believe I’m a decent presenter. I’ve honed my presentation skills to the point I can effectively present the team’s ideas and sell them to a broad audience. Paired with stunning visuals... I can convince anyone 😎
