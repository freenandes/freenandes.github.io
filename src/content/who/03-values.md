### What values guide you?

I'm focused on being a more efficient communicator. In any context, really: family, neighborhood, work, grocery store, anywhere. I try to listen carefully to others to understand them more and empathize with their feelings.

I feel that's the most important value for a good life and a better relationship with others. Not only in avoiding conflicts but as a way to grow and live healthier. Peace is underrated.
