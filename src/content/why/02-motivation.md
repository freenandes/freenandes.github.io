### How do you stay motivated and inspired?

I take inspiration from daily routines, pay attention to my surroundings, read peopleâ€™s expressions, and learn from communication patterns, body expressions, etc. I don't look much into trends. They usually only solve other people's lack of inspiration.

Connecting to the present and life is the best and most humble way to stay motivated. Activities like traveling, meeting others, absorbing different ways of doing things, and appreciating nature motivate me to change and discover new methodologies.
