# Pedro MC Fernandes

## Product Designer

Hi, my name is Pedro, and I'm a designer inspired by art and creativity. I want to contribute to building a more accessible world. While I have experience working in various industries, my focus has been on digital technology. There are many challenges in digital tech, and I aim to design better experiences to help us overcome problems and live healthier.

### 9+ years of Design systematization

I always prioritize the systematization of Design in a more predictable, organizable, and cost-effective way. I've worked like this for a long time, where I had the trust and freedom to manage products this way. It's one of the best ways to ensure coherence.

### 8+ years as a digital Product Designer

I worked in Design Operations and Design Systems, setting up processes, documentation, facilitating cross-collaboration, and boosting design impact and efficacy. I also worked hands-on in User Experience Research and Design, crafting digital solutions to recurring and critical user problems. I have worked in Experimentation and User Testing to shape products in a better direction. And I also worked on influencing Back-end architecture and crafting Front-end Development bits to complete our vision and prepare us for a smoother implementation.

### 6+ years of mentorship

I played a mentorship role in hiring and welcoming new colleagues. I helped them with onboarding and motivated them to share their ideas and opinions early on with stakeholders and colleagues. I made myself available to them anytime to give and receive feedback and help them have more guidance where needed.
