### How do you approach testing and validating your designs?

There are a lot of methods to choose from, and it depends on what I need. If we want to go fast, testing internally might be good. I can get quick feedback from experts, engineers, customer-centric roles, and even other designers, and get a diverse perspective that usually uncovers out-of-the-box ideas.

I can also quickly get users to test the information architecture with tree testing and card sorting. And quickly test interfaces with wireframe prototypes.

I would instead rely on user testing to extract more data and mature the ideas properly, when possible. The best would be to pick customers to improve the product through interviews and focus groups or meticulously screen paid users to test new features or launch new products.

When the idea grows, I seek to fine-tune its details with usability and multi-variant tests if we have too many options. Whatever technique we adopt, I try to steer in the same direction, that we are doing so to meet the needs and expectations of the users and customers.
