![Amalgamation of screen prints from documentation pages. Most content is about user experience design research such as user personas, interview guides, testing techniques, cases, etc.](./research-operations.png)

I look at research outputs as pieces to build a centralized insights documentation hub. Not simply organized notes but an amalgamation of text, diagrams, and drawings that help communicate problems, solutions, ideas, people's needs, business objectives, and more.

I look into promoting it to share knowledge, processes, and a continuous improvement culture within the team.

I believe that with a good research repository, we can infuse user-centricity into what we do and make data-driven decisions.
