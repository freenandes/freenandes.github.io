### How do you approach the research phase?

It's advisable to start with a data-driven approach. To see what we have, I reach out to other departments or colleagues to get their points of view on the users and get empirical data. This usually leads to ideas on where or how to source quantitative and qualitative data.

I try to explain why we use it, so everyone can be on the lookout for changes or generate periodic reports. These will become useful once we change or launch a new product.

I also collect the data points on a whiteboard. I map this information and connect it to the designs to invite everyone to participate and iterate. This approach requires a well-organized board to help colleagues to navigate and understand what's there.
