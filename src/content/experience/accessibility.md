With my design experience, accessibility comes more naturally to me. I'm more guided by inclusivity and by propagating it. For this, I set up tools, patterns, and documentation that help the team make more inclusive decisions.

I've spent much time looking into the latest web standards, producing the most calibrated color palettes, selecting the most relevant signifiers for the broadest array of people possible, incorporating content where it's missing for some, providing better integration with assistive and non-assistive software and peripherals.

It's too much work for one, so successfully implementing accessibility standards requires the whole team. It's here that I can lead efforts to keep everyone up to speed with the best practices and make sure everyone knows what guidelines we will need to follow to broaden the user base.
