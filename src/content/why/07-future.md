### Where do you want to go from here?

I see myself continuing to do the good with my design powers. Learn to share. I also want to help build a better world.

A world where we have a better relationship with technology. One where everyone is invited and doesn't feel excluded. One where everyone can enjoy, enhance and grow their abilities, and feel motivated to co-create a better world with me.

In the future, I would like to be more involved with improving creativity and creation processes. Be more involved in improving operations, facilitate design within teams, and I want to design products that people love to use.
