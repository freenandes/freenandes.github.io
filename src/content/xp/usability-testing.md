It is a humbling and enlightening process that provides a window into the product's performance, allowing us to remove any lingering doubts or uncover any issues that may have been previously overlooked.

I ensure that we ask the most critical questions, evaluate the interface's usability, and gather as much quantitative data as possible to provide insights for production.

The qualitative data we can get is invaluable, but I believe that the quantitative plays a crucial role. Analyzing the efficacy, trends, and patterns becomes even more helpful when we increase the sample size. This information can help us develop a tracking strategy and make informed decisions about the final product.

This is not only about identifying areas of improvement but also about fostering a deeper understanding of the process and how we shape it with data.
