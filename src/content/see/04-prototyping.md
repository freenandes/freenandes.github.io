### What do you use for prototyping and how do you iterate?

It depends on speed and accuracy. Usually, I decide on using the design tool we have at hand. Almost any tool works, really. Especially if we’re OK with a wireframe-style prototype, even a sketch on paper will suffice. Whatever can get us, as a collective, into feedback and some data, fast.

Code prototypes are more accurate, however. Implementing them can take longer, but it’s perfect for more complex problems. A code prototype with a wide array of interactivity will output high-quality data when testing and is helpful, in the long run, to ship faster.

The so-called 'no handoff' makes sense for specific work conditions.")

![View of the calendar with a modal window prompting the user to add an absence by defining the type and then the dates.](../../assets/images/slayout-03.png "This is part of a project where we designed and built the app parts to test with linguistic experts in task management operations.")

While getting these prototype artifacts out, I usually set up collaborative sessions within the team or with some internal guerilla tests. This way, I can gather diversified views on the materialization of the solution.

Iterating involves incorporating collected decisions into a new version of the designs and then having mechanisms to share that again with the team quickly. We can use that new version even for subsequent rounds of testing or, if we're already confident, directly to implementation handoff.
