Encouraging a culture of design within a team means ensuring that everyone collaborates effectively in crafting solutions that put the user's needs first. I believe in simplifying the design process by presenting it in a clear, understandable manner. One way to achieve this is by empowering all team members to take an active role and contribute to the design process. This can be done by providing more evidence of problems, benchmarking, or encouraging greater participation from customers and other users.

The purpose of promoting design is to cultivate a design-oriented mindset that spans multiple departments and enables cross-functional collaboration between them. Delivering valuable services and experiences to people necessitates that everyone contributes to crafting a solution. While design can enhance collaboration, solutions are co-owned through our everyday efforts.
