### How do you approach the design process?

Ideally, I like to follow a documented process. I think itâ€™s a gift we can strategize and create solutions methodically. I like to admire other methodologies, learn how they work, and use them.

Going by the book's not always possible, so I improvise where needed. Luckily having experience in design helps, and I can anticipate where we can cut corners. Different problems require different approaches, and I help adapt to get fast to the best solution.
