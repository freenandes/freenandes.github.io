### Why are you a designer?

Iâ€™m passionate about creativity. I love to create, break down problems, and have new ideas. I like discovering solutions and always get excited when they come up.

It's also natural for me. I draw and sketch a lot, and that specific skill is helpful for design. It changes the way I think and how I approach problems. It forces me to focus on the visual outcome and is a more powerful communication tool with myself and others.
