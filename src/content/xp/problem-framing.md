Complex issues require concerted, collaborative efforts. After picking substantial insights, the first thing I do is to shape clear problem statements that allow the team to collaborate effectively.

My goal is to ensure we're all on the same page first, then working together to make a positive impact through our design efforts. From problem statements to hypotheses generation is a quick ride, so this preparative work is a great way to propel innovation.
