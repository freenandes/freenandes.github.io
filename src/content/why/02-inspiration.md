### How do you stay motivated and inspired?

I take inspiration from daily routines, pay attention to my surroundings, read peopleâ€™s expressions, and learn from communication patterns, body expressions, etc. I think witnessing life is the best and most humble way to stay motivated, and it stimulates creativity and inspires new methodologies.
