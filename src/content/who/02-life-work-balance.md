### How do you balance your personal and professional life?

It isn't easy to separate them. It's all the same life. There are no illusions here. Work is necessary today. I tend to become too enthralled with new ideas. The excitement of getting into a new idea pulls me in very quickly.

To create a barrier and be focused on what matters, I go outside to breathe fresh air, spend time with the family, drink warm beverages, and listen to tranquil music. I also dedicate some time to art projects that help me de-stress.
