### How do you approach the research phase?

I prefer to do the research as organized as possible and backed up with lots of visuals to better understand notes, sketches, quotes, data, etc. I learn better visually, so itâ€™s better to use a tool like Miro or FigJam. This also allows it to be easily shared and presented to teammates and request their contribution to the research board.
