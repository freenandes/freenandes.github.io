With experience, accessibility comes more naturally to me. I'm guided by inclusivity and by propagating it.

I set up tools, patterns, and documentation that help the team be more inclusive. This constant reminder helps gather more users for our products and provides a quality service to the community.

I've spent much time looking into the latest web standards, producing the most calibrated color palettes, selecting the most relevant signifiers for the broadest array of people possible, incorporating content where it's missing for some, providing better integration with assistive and non-assistive software and peripherals.

It's a lot to look into, but successful implementation of accessibility standards requires the whole team, and it's here that I can lead efforts to keep everyone up to speed with the best practices.
