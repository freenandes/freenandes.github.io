### How do you stay active and interact with the community?

I do my best to participate in events, but primarily online, due to family needs and time constraints. I get news, tools, and techniques from LinkedIn, newsletters, and some key websites, but I don't put too much pressure on it.

I don't interact much with the design community. I watch and read from afar. I occasionally contributed to others that sparked my interests and hobbies, like open source web frameworks, the comic books community, graphic design and illustration communities, radio and music communities on social media, etc.
