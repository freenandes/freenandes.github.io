### Have you found user research to provide a positive impact?

Absolutely! User research has been essential to me! I gain valuable insights, empathize more with users and better understand their problems and needs, allowing me to create user-centered designs.

I can identify pain points and usability issues more quickly and understand where the opportunities are. By interpreting the findings effectively, we can all make more informed design decisions and iterate before a more confident implementation.

It also helps me validate initial assumptions, weed out personal bias, and get to test with real users. This interaction is precious and eye-opening. Allows me to refine and optimize the designs and get solid foundations for a better user experience.
