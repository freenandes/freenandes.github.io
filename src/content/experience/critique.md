I have created a framework for design critique that helps enhance the product design iteration process through a collective approach. This framework invites participants from the product development field to present their work, be it a feature, a complete product, or a new concept. The objective of this framework is to be inclusive and welcome feedback from any background, not just from design professionals.

Acknowledging the demanding nature of our work calendars, I've made it possible to participate asynchronously. It's a more sensitive and caring approach that makes a product critique more laid back and enticing. It enables continuous feedback beyond the confines of scheduled sessions. Ultimately, it leads to a more refined and collaborative design outcome.
