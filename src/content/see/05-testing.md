### How do you approach testing and validating designs?

There is a lot to choose from, depending on what we need. If we want to go fast, testing internally might be good. I can get quick feedback from experts, engineers, customer-centric roles, and even other designers, and get a diverse perspective that usually uncovers out-of-the-box ideas.

I can also quickly get paid users to test the information architecture with tree testing and card sorting. And quickly test interfaces with wireframe, scrappy prototypes.

But I would prefer to rely on more solid user testing to extract more data and mature the ideas properly. The best would be to pick customers to improve the product through interviews and focus groups or meticulously screen paid users to test new features or launch new products.

When the idea grows, I seek to fine-tune its details with usability and multi-variant tests. Whatever technique we adopt, I try to steer in the same direction, that we are doing so to meet the needs and expectations of the users and customers.
