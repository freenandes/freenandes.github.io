### What can you tell about yourself?

My name is Pedro MC Fernandes. I can start by saying I’m a creative person, and I love the art world. I enjoy digging that scene, getting inspired, doing random stuff on sketchbooks, exploring, being creative.

I currently work as a product designer in tech. I have a lot of design experience in several industries, more recently with digital products.

But more importantly, I’m a family man and love spending as much time as possible with my partner and daughter — nothing beats that.

If you get to know me, you'll see I'm shy at first, but if you're patient enough, you'll get to know me and my lousy puns!
