Throughout my 16 years in the design industry, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge and experience, which I now use to mentor others. My main goal is to help onboard new designers, guide them through the initial phases of their work, and instill confidence in them to share their ideas.

Mentoring has also been about fostering a two-way street of feedback. I keep my door open, ready to provide insights, share my experiences, lead by example by going the extra mile, taking ownership, and exercising creativity, or just lend a listening ear. It's about building a nurturing environment where feedback is welcomed, ideas are exchanged, and everyone feels a sense of belonging and contribution.
