### What do you use for prototyping and how do you iterate?

It depends on speed and accuracy. Usually, I decide on using the design tool we have at hand. Almost any tool works, really. Especially if we’re OK with a wireframe-style prototype. Even a sketch on paper will suffice. Whatever can get us into feedback and data fast.

Code prototypes are more accurate, however. Implementing them can take longer, but it’s perfect for more complex problems. A code prototype with a wide array of interactivity will output high-quality data when user testing and is more helpful in the long run to ship faster.

While getting these prototype artifacts out, I usually set up collaborative sessions within the team or with some internal guerilla tests. This way, I can gather diverse views on the materialization of the solution.

Iterating involves the design team or me incorporating collected decisions into some new design versions. We can then use them for subsequent rounds of tests or implementation hand-offs if we're confident in the data.
