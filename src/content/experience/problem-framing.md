Complex issues require concerted, collaborative efforts. After picking substantial insights, the first thing I do is to shape clear problem statements that allow the team to collaborate effectively.

My goal is to ensure we're all on the same page first, then working together to make a positive impact through our design efforts. From problem statements to hypotheses generation is a quick ride, so this preparative work is a great way to propel innovation.

I make sure that, whatever "detective" work was done before, it is more digested and readable for the whole team. We can use them as presentation assets to communicate with other teams and the rest of the community.
