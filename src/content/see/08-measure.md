### How do you measure the success of your solutions?

I work with the team towards establishing success metrics for the initiative. The process is to review the goals weâ€™ve been focused on and break them down into tangible metrics that align with the user flows. Or if we're fixing something, using the problems' evidence usually gives us some good tracking ideas.

We then lock some critical touchpoints and decide how to measure them. Depending on the initiative, we can even escalate to the design system and attach tracking to components to measure from multiple product touchpoints.
