### How do you plan your growth?

I look into what I am today. I donâ€™t look much into the future, so I don't plan per se in my personal life. There are way too many variables to control. I bet on self-reviews to learn from mistakes and areas for improvement.

I do see myself with my partner helping my daughter grow, trying to be her best friend, and helping her thrive and do her best in her community.
