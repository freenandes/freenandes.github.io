### What methods do you use for prototyping, and how do you iterate based on feedback?

It depends on speed and accuracy. Usually, I decide on using the design tool we have at hand. Anything works, really. Especially if we’re OK with a wireframe-style prototype. A sketch on paper will suffice to get fast feedback. It’s fast and a quick route to testing and getting data.

Code prototypes are more accurate. Implementing them can take longer, but it’s perfect for more complex problems. A code prototype with a wide array of interactivity will provide high-quality data when user testing and is more helpful in the long run to ship things faster.

While getting these prototype artifacts out, I usually set up collaborative sessions within the team or with internal guerilla testings. This way, I can gather diverse views on the materialization of the solution and early critiques.

Iterating involves me or the design team incorporating decisions into new design versions. We can then use them for subsequent rounds of tests or implementation hand-offs if we're confident in the data we have.
