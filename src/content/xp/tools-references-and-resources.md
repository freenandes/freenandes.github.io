One of my routines is to be on the lookout. Reading about other methodologies, the tools that fabricate the latest products, and other's experience in the design practice. A big part of design is absorbing knowledge.

What I like to do is to cultivate a culture of sharing. I use my writing and organizational skills to quickly spin up documentation with references for inspiration, heuristic techniques, industry standards, toolkits, case studies, and more.

I also like to research and test new tools and gather with the team to integrate and set up the best ones, design the workflows, optimize work, and get faster outcomes.

In many situations, for me, it's like entering a rabbit hole. The passion that drives it is the pleasure of getting a happy team with everything at hand and the higher chances of serendipity rain.
