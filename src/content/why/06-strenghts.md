### What do you consider to be your greatest strengths?

I admit I’m obsessed with UI “perfection,” which leads me to put extra effort into conveying ideas accurately. It's a blessing and a curse, but experience helps me from overdoing it. I actually like how nowadays I go faster and get happy with results earlier than before.

This extends to my modularization obsessions. I love optimizing my files, either designs, references, or code, so they are as centralized as possible to save me from repetitive work and iterate faster in the long run.

I also believe I’m a decent presenter. I’ve honed my presentation skills to the point I can effectively present the team’s ideas and sell them to a broad audience. Paired with stunning visuals... I can convince anyone!
