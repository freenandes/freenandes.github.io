### How do you balance user needs and business goals?

An early view of the users' pains and needs is crucial. Allows me to get vital information on how we can succeed without going blindly and prematurely into a solution. With enough early research, we can create an execution plan that aligns with business goals and get buy-in from the stakeholders.

I think keeping straightforward communication throughout the design process is also essential. Leaving an open channel, transparent documentation, and inviting as many stakeholders and partners as possible to review what we are building right from the start.

In my view, it's essential to build a working group. A group of people that understand the problems we're facing and then share the same vision for what we're trying to achieve. It allows for a more collaborative process around the business goals.

This process is crucial because I don't believe in business goals that come out of thin air and grow generic. For a successful user-centered product, at least a good foundation of user research is needed to inform and break down business goals into something more tangible.
