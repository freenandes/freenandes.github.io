### What can you tell about yourself?

You already know my name, Pedro MC Fernandes, so I can start by saying I’m an arts person. I enjoy digging into the scene, getting inspired, doing random stuff on sketchbooks, exploring, being creative.

I work as a product designer, currently in tech. I have now 16 years of design experience in several industries and almost 10 years with digital products.

But above all, I’m a family man and love spending as much time as possible with them. I'm also shy at first, but if you're patient enough, you'll get to know me and my lousy puns!
