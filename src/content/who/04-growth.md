### How do you grow and plan the future?

I look into what I am today. I donâ€™t look much into my future self, so I don't plan my personal life per se. There are way too many variables to control. I bet on self-assessments to learn from my mistakes and maybe look for a few areas of improvement.

I see myself with my partner helping my daughter grow, be her best friend, and help her thrive and do her best in her community.
