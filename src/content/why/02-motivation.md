### How do you stay motivated and inspired?

I don't look much into trends. Nowadays, they are empty of substance and filled with copycats. I prefer to take inspiration from daily routines, pay attention to my surroundings, read peopleâ€™s expressions, and learn from communication patterns, body expressions, etc.

Staying connected to the present moment and deriving inspiration from daily life is my way of staying motivated. Activities like traveling, meeting others, absorbing different ways of doing things, and appreciating nature motivate me to change and discover new methodologies.
