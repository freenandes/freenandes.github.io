### How do you collaborate with cross-functional teams?

I think communication is key, so I try to get to know everyone first and explain what I do as a product designer. Also, I try to set up open and inclusive communication channels, so they can receive updates or provide feedback or new intel about users and customers.

This is important when a design team is new in the company or when a new initiative starts. Having documentation ready for this is also very important, so I try to condense all of the above into it and have a documented working process.

I also think involving the team and hosting collaborative sessions is essential. This can help them feel more included in the process, more motivated, and start seeing the value of generating user-centered designs more clearly.
