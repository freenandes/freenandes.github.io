title: "Strengths"

### What do you consider to be your greatest strengths?

I’m obsessed with UI “perfection,” which leads me to put extra effort into conveying ideas accurately. It's a blessing and a curse. There's the risk of overdoing it.

The experience helps me control it. Taking breaks and switching tasks helps put a different perspective and reassess efforts. I'm happier with my current pace and how the results improve and come out with less effort with more maturity.

This extends to my modularization obsessions. I love optimizing my files, either designs, references, or code, so they are as centralized as possible to save me from repetitive work and iterate faster in the long run.

I extend to pattern visualizations to explain differences between multiple screen sizes, for example.")

I also believe I’m a decent presenter. I’ve honed my skills for a while. I stopped stuttering, sweating profusely, and I no longer tremble, I think... Paired with "stunning" visuals... I can convince anyone my ideas are the best!
